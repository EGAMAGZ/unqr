# UNQR
A client-side QR code generator with PWA capabilities, designed to function offline.

[![Made with Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/fresh-badge.svg)](https://fresh.deno.dev)

## Motivation
Many QR code tools either require users to log in, redirect to their services, or display intrusive ads. Additionally, many of these tools don't support offline usage.

The projectâ€™s name is inspired by [Unduck](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck), a project by [Theogg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg).
